TypeError for area(10) call: The error indicates that the area() method is not designed to accept any arguments. You should update your area() method definition to accept arguments or revise the test accordingly.
Exception for area() method call: The test expects an Exception to be raised when calling area() without implementation. Ensure that your BaseGeometry class defines the area() method and raises an appropriate exception when it's called without implementation.
TypeError for integer_validator() calls: Similar to the area() method, the integer_validator() method seems to have issues with argument handling. Ensure that the method signature and argument handling are appropriate for your implementation.
TypeErrors for incorrect integer_validator() calls: The tests check various scenarios where integer_validator() should raise a TypeError or ValueError. Ensure that your integer_validator() method correctly handles these cases and raises appropriate exceptions.
ValueError for integer_validator("key", 0) call: The test expects a ValueError to be raised when the value is 0. Ensure that your integer_validator() method checks for this condition and raises a ValueError as expected.
ValueError for integer_validator("key", -1000) call: Similar to the previous case, ensure that your integer_validator() method correctly handles negative values and raises a ValueError when appropriate.
integer_validator() method handling for empty string and None: Ensure that your integer_validator() method handles empty strings and None values appropriately.
TypeError for incorrect value types in integer_validator() calls: Ensure that your integer_validator() method checks for the correct types of the name and value arguments and raises a TypeError when inappropriate types are passed.
TypeError for tuple and dict values in integer_validator() calls: Ensure that your integer_validator() method correctly handles tuple and dict values and raises a TypeError when appropriate.
area() method should be an instance method: Ensure that the area() method is properly defined as an instance method by including self as the first parameter in its definition.
